This project investigates the effectiveness of three image enhancement techniques for chest X-ray images from the NIH Chest X-ray Dataset, aiming to improve diagnostic quality in respiratory condition assessment.

## Techniques Evaluated

1. **Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)**
2. **Gamma Correction combined with CLAHE**
3. **Wavelet Denoising combined with CLAHE**

## Key Metrics

- Execution time
- Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)
- Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM)

## Dataset

The project uses the [NIH Chest X-ray Dataset](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-clinical-center-provides-one-largest-publicly-available-chest-x-ray-datasets-scientific-community), a large-scale collection of de-identified chest X-rays.

## Results

Our evaluation demonstrates significant improvements in image clarity, with findings that can assist radiologists and medical professionals in diagnostic processes.
